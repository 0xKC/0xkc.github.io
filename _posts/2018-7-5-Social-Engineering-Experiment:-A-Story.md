This is not a technical post. Just my experience with social engineering.But it was more of physical security assessment than a social engineering engagement.

I am not a social engineer and never pretended/wanted to be one(though its one of the field that fascinates me). I have conducted a few phishing campaigns but never went on engagements.

Disclaimer : I am sharing this story after taking permission and am conscious about not giving out much. The USB the code was copied onto is company provided (which is usually not the case with engagements). This was not a paid engagement.

This happened in mid- 2014 when I was having a discussion with my friend who works as a Technical Lead for an emerging startup who was securing government projects. Pretty sure they were not top secret but still government projects.

He was rambling about all the security "trainings", security "procedures" that were in place. My brain was having all these questions
1) How are you quantifying the learnings?
2) Are the employees vetted? ( Something like SC clearance in the UK )


I said I would like to test out as an experiment the training effectiveness. He talked to his CEO and he was cool about the experiment(I had permission letter and USB drive I had to copy code to etc).


### Pretext

As it was an emerging startup what better pretext than an appearing for an interview. I asked my friend to send out a call for interview mail from his **personal** account to my personal gmail account. 

### Interview day

I went to the location all dressed up,my interview glasses on,clean shave and looked like I was really there for an interview . I went out showed the mail at the security desk.There was no verification if it was from a company account nor the person was informed so that they can escort me into the premises.No government issued ID verification either. I talked to my friend as soon as I entered and was conscious that everyone sees me talking to their lead. I went straight to an unoccupied workspace and looked around for passwords already thinking of reasons to come up with to ask the person adjacent to my workspace for a password. There I found it "Jul@2014" written inside a book on the desk(Change password every 30 days rule FTW).  

I went straight to the desk and proceeded to unlock the computer. People assumed I was a new employee and never once bothered me or asked me what i was doing at a system that was assigned to another employee. I logged into the system, copied a bunch of files onto my USB drive which I did not even need to smuggle into the premises and went to the printer location to dumpster dive. There was no shredder and all the documents were lying near the printer.

### The big reveal

I went to the CEOs office who only knew my name and never met me in person(I used an alias for the interview). I went ahead and gave him papers that were lying near the printer, The code that I copied onto the USB drive and said how I went about this experiment. 

Mind you, I was not a professional, And this is not some ninja/jedi level engagement. I just walked in under a false pretext and could have easily walked out with their entire code repository. I did not even need a rubber ducky,raspberry pi or any advanced gear to PWN them.

CEO then gathered the employees around and asked who I was. Everyone assumed I was a new employee, no one verified,no one checked why I did not have an ID card but still was accessing the system and printer area. I told them how I entered, moved comfortably and confidently to avoid suspicion. All the training you get by watching videos, answering quizzes should be put to use. 

### Words from Experts

Jayson Street, who is a professional at such engagements( once broke into a high scale hotel in the South of France - barefoot - wearing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pajamas ), says employees **may not learn** through security trainings that have multiple choice questions and mandatory trainings that come once a quarter. You have to ensure there are teachable moments. **Make them believe they are part of your security team.**
